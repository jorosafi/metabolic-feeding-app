# Organic Acidemia Baby Bottle Feeding Tracker


### Background
My wife and I had a baby boy in August 2020 in Prince Rupert BC, just two weeks before I started the BCS program. 
On his third night at the hospital, the nurses noticed he was breathing abnormally fast. They immediately took him for 
further examination and prepared us to be airlifted to Prince George, which had the nearest NICU. 

This started a two-week stay at the hospital in Prince George and later the BC Children's Hospital in Vancouver, 
where the doctors found Santiago, our baby, has a rare metabolic disease called Isovaleric Acidemia (IVA). He is missing a
digestive enzyme, which prevents him from properly digesting protein. If he has more protein than what his body can
digest, he can go into a metabolic crisis that can lead to neurological damage and developmental delays. 
But having too little food can be equally dangerous as the human body breaks down protein in the muscle mass 
as a store of energy when there is no more food to digest.

The biggest challenge we've had over the past six months has been to bottle-feed him. He has a very strict diet
that is constantly being tweaked by nutritionists at the BC Children's hospital to account for his nutritional needs
and the amount of protein his body can safely digest. We measure all of his formula ingredients to the nearest gram,
and have to keep track of how much he is eating and when. 

### The App

While there are a myriad of feeding apps for adults, children and babies, there is no decent app that meets the needs 
for babies suffering this disease as it is extremely rare. 

This is why I want to build an app that can help us track his nutritional intake and keep better data that can be 
shared with his medical team. This app will be used by me and my wife and, if I find it works for us, I can offer to 
build a publicly available version for other IVA families. 

I am hoping this app will have the following features:
- A user will be able to input how much the baby needs to eat in a day and over how many feeds. So, a caregiver can
say the baby needs to eat 800ml of formula spread over 8 feeds in the day. 
- Each feed can be assigned to a caregiver. So caregiver A can take the feeds 1, 2, and 6, while 
caregiver B can take the rest of the feeds. 
- The caregivers can input quantitative and qualitative data about the feed that can be shared with other caregivers
and the baby's medical team. 
    - How much did the baby drink? 
    - How long did it take him to finish the feed?
    - Did he spit or puke a lot?
    - Was he still hungry after the feed?
- The app will add up how much of the feed the baby missed throughout the day. This information can be passed on to the 
medical team by the caregivers as needed. 
- The caregivers can track the supply of medical formula ingredients left and when new orders have to be made. 
Given the importance of this formula, caregivers are encouraged to always keep a month's supply of the formula 
in case of emergency or shipment delays. The caregivers can input the formula recipe and the supply of ingredients, 
so the app can estimate how many days worth of ingredients the caregivers have left. 

### Looking ahead

After I am done with CPSC 210, I would like to add extra features to this app as the baby grows and our needs evolve. 
Eventually, I would like to take this code base and use it for an android app that includes a cloud database so each 
caregiver can input and view information from their phones or any connected device.

As he starts eating solid foods, it's also important to track the nutritional information of foods, so in the long run 
I would like to find a database of nutritional information for foods that can connect to the app to track the 
nutritional intake of the child as he grows up. 

Other apps for children and adults with organic acidemias (the family of diseases that IVA belongs to) have been 
developed, but none of them meet all the criteria of being good, be available on android, and have all the features
we need. If I decide to develop this further, I may reach out to the developers of the existing apps and see if it is 
possible to collaborate to improve existing products.
